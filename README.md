# PowerBI e-commerce Report

This is a dashboard created with the PowerBI tool for an anonymous e-commerce business based in the UK, for the period of December 2018 to December 2019.
Full details along with the original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/an-online-shop-business).

The main questions this analysis intends to answer are:
1. What was the trend in the number of purchases made throughout this period? (Along with some information about cancelled purchases/transactions)
2. Which regions/countries purchased the most/least amount of goods?
3. Which products were purchased the most during this period?
4. Some basic stats of course, ie. the average number of goods purchased per country.

The Dataset was transformed using Microsoft excel.
